# leaflet_challenge
NW Bootcamp Leaflet HW

This homework uses mapbox, leaflet, and javascript to build an interactive map of all earthquakes in the last 7 days using data from the United States Geological Survey API.

# Part 1
Part one plots earthquakes from the last seven days using latitude and longitude coordinates. The color of the circle represents the depth of the earthquake while the radius of the circle represents the magnitude of the earthquake. The larger the circle, the greater the magnitude.

# Part 2

Part 2 of the homework plots the same earthquake data, but adds a control panel to switch between map backgrounds (streets, dark, satellite) and turns the earthquake layer on and off.
